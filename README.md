# Trainspotter
A tounge-in-cheek way to follow train schedules--

This project combined using moment, firebase and basic javascript to create a user-input driven database of train schedules, allowing you to determine next arrival times from first train time and frequency. 
User inputs 4 variables: name, destination, first train time and frequency, and is provided with the following outputs in a dynamic database held in Firebase: 

    - Train Name
    - Destination
    - Frequency
    - Next Arrival
    - Minutes Away
    
This can be used by, and will log entries from, multiple users in firebase and push them as a single database to the page. 

Used:
- JavaScript
- Jquery
- Moment
- Firebase
- css3
- html5
